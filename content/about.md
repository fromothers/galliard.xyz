**Galliard** is a typeface designed by Matthew Carter and
published by the International Typeface Corporation in 1978.
It is also the name of a Renaissance-era dance that was
popular all over Europe in the 16th century.

Thus, the name represents both a beautiful experience as well
as the playful exuberance of dance. Both these elements
are hopefully present in this website, and in life as well.

These writings are a meager attempt to capture the beauty, precision,
and playfulness of life and the world around us.
