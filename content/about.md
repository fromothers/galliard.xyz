**Galliard** is a typeface designed by Matthew Carter and published
by the International Typeface Corporation in 1978.  It is also the
name of a Renaissance-era dance that was popular all over Europe
in the 16th century.

Thus, the name represents both a beautiful experience as well as
the playful exuberance of dance. Both these elements are hopefully
present in this website, and in life as well.

These writings are an attempt to capture, in words, the beauty,
precision, and playfulness of life and the world around us.
