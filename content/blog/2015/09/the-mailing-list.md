Email actually predates the Internet. Users of the Internet's
predecessor, [ARPANET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET),
developed file-based messaging systems akin to leaving a note on
someone's door. This simple method progressed to full-blown network
distribution of messages.  [Within a few years, 75% of ARPANET
traffic was
email](http://www.nethistory.info/History%20of%20the%20Internet/email.html).

Email evolved into [USENET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet),
a lyrical maelstrom of messages distributed in an email-like manner,
and containing topics ranging from comics to pornography and
everything in between and beyond.

[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com) is now by far the dominant
leader in social media, connecting a substantial portion of the
Earth's human inhabitants on a daily basis. Email, however, is still
around and still in daily use.

While Facebook is extraordinarily good at capturing interactions
between people, its sheer size makes it less good at capturing
smaller groups. I tend to think of Facebook as an enormous convention
center. I can wander around for hours, ducking into various rooms
and seeing what all my friends are up to on a daily basis. It's
algorithmic approach to showing me "stuff that's interesting to me"
is actually very good, but it fails miserably at capturing an entire
conversation or detailed back-and-forth between people. The "sound
bites" of Facebook keep me connected, but they provide little depth
to my imagination or intellectual stimulation.

My mailing lists, on the other hand, are not nearly so good for
keeping up with the relatives, but they do provide that in-depth,
intimate discussions that's missing from the broader realm of social
media.[^1]

I'm currently a member of several different mailing lists (not even
counting those "announcement" type lists that I use to keep up with
the latest software releases). Mailing lists have several advantages
over something like Facebook for discussion. First, email is
asynchronous. I can filter emails into their own folder and browse
them at my leisure.

Second, email is complete: I get every single message (unlike
Facebook, where an algorithm chooses what it thinks I want to see).

Third, email is personal: each message comes from an individual,
and contains his or her unique slant on the content. (I'm distinguishing
this from content that comes from, say, a news organization.) In
many cases, I have an existing relationship with the individuals
sending the emails.  In other cases, I have developed relationships
with people *because* of the emails.

Finally, email is permanent. In most cases, emails are archived and
are available for years in the future. If they're not, then I can
keep my own copies around, and I have complete access to the
information.

There are two mailing lists that I am a member of that are most
dear to me. The first is the [Tech Breakfast
list](http://xlerb.email/mailman/listinfo/breakfast); this started
a few years ago when I was living in Silicon Valley.  A group of
us started meeting on occasional Saturday mornings for breakfast,
and, since we were all part of "the industry" in the Valley, our
discussions were mostly centered around technology, politics, and
related topics. It's an impressive group of people, with members
who have been founders or participants at some of the technology
industry's coolest companies over the last 20-30 years, and other
who have designed nuclear reactors, built rocketships, and invented
everything from file server appliances to egg candling devices to
bowling-alley ball return machines. For privacy, the list messages
are not archived, but there's typically a dozen or so messages per
week, all of which are interesting. This is a closed list, meaning
that you can't join unless you are recommended or approved by an
existing list member.

The second list that I dearly love is the Gunroom of the [HMS
Surprise](http://hmssurprise.org/). This is a list that was established
twenty years ago to discuss "The works of [Patrick
O'Brian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_O%27Brian) and
anything else." I joined the list sometime in 1995, before there
was a formal archive, and my first recorded post was [on Hallowe'en
of that year](http://mat.gsia.cmu.edu/POB/19xx/OCT95/0060.html).
What a fascinating, delightful group of people! I've come to know
and love many of them, and sadly have watched a number of them
depart this life. This list is open and public, and anyone
can join by
[following the instructions here](http://www.hmssurprise.org/gunroom-access-and-settings).



[^1]: Note that [Friendfeed](http://isfriendfeeddeadyet.com), which was acquired by Facebook, had many of the advantages that I attribute to email. For example, *everything* was visible; there was no algorithm that chose what the system thought I wanted to see.
